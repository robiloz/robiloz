-  hitting my self with CISCO books in the hope that the information gets in it and blocking website's requests one by one to see at what point they break.
-
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Microsoft 365, Azure, Networking, cybersecurity and how to install Proxmox-VE on my 8 year old laptop (help).
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the things that make the green dots brigter. Thry are the only source of dopamin that still hits. Other than that, I'm intreasted to learn about github and people in it.
